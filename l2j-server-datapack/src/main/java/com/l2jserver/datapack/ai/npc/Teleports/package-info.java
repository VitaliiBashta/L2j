/**
 * Teleporter AIs are used for teleports that are too advanced to be done under normal means.<br>
 * For example, teleporting to the race track allows a player a free teleport and a free return to the same city from which the player went to the race track.<br>
 * Normal teleports do not store any information about the origin.<br>
 * In order to achieve this special teleportation, a teleport script is needed.<br>
 * <br>
 * All implementation details are fully covered by quests.<br>
